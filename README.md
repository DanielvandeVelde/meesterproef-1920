# Meesterproef @cmda-minor-web 1920

Hi there.

This is the space reserved for my readme which will hold the most valueble information and give you some insights into how things work.  
For now this will link to my [wiki](https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/meesterproef-1920/wiki) which holds my debriefing as well as the first few sketches I made for my concept.

Currently I'm creating different prototypes.  
These are based on the first sketches and are currently focused on look & feel as well as UI.  
Currently they can be found here:

- [Starting page](https://danielvandevelde.github.io/meesterproef-1920/demos/start.html)
- [Upload page](https://danielvandevelde.github.io/meesterproef-1920/demos/upload.html)
- [Triples + visualisation](https://danielvandevelde.github.io/meesterproef-1920/demos/visualisation1.html#content)
- [Visualisation + visual editor](https://danielvandevelde.github.io/meesterproef-1920/demos/visualisation2.html)
- [Triples](https://danielvandevelde.github.io/meesterproef-1920/demos/triples.html)

These are just rough prototypes and they all have various degrees of 'kinda' working.  
Most important is getting some information from various stakeholders about the design, look & feel as well as usability and all that.
