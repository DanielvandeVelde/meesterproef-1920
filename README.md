# Meesterproef @cmda-minor-web 1920

Hi there.

This is the space reserved for my readme which will hold the most valueble information and give you some insights into how things work.  
For now this will link to my [wiki](https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/meesterproef-1920/wiki) which holds my debriefing as well as the first few sketches I made for my concept.

So whenever I have something good to show; I'll put it right here.
