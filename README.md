# Meesterproef @cmda-minor-web 1920

Hi there.

In this readme will soon be a bunch of technical stuff about this project.  
How to install it, how the basics of the application work (probably the API, D3 etc.).    
For now this will link to my [wiki](https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/meesterproef-1920/wiki) which holds my debriefing as well as the first few sketches and prototypes I made for my concept.

Soon I will do some research and create different visualisations for different situations/datasets to view the data in a way thats easiest for the user.  
 Currently I'm creating different prototypes that focus on the look & feel.
These are based on the first sketches and are currently focused on look & feel as well as UI.  
Currently they can be found here:

- [Starting page](https://danielvandevelde.github.io/meesterproef-1920/demos/start.html) - Trying the corporate look & feel. Style only.
- [Upload page](https://danielvandevelde.github.io/meesterproef-1920/demos/upload.html) - Little bit cooler, might be annoying for clients.
- [Triples + visualisation](https://danielvandevelde.github.io/meesterproef-1920/demos/visualisation1.html#content) - No real results. Can be clicked and such.
- [Visualisation + visual editor](https://danielvandevelde.github.io/meesterproef-1920/demos/visualisation2.html) - Works to create, no export yet.
- [Triples](https://danielvandevelde.github.io/meesterproef-1920/demos/triples.html) - Works to edit and such, Nothing real yet.

These are just rough prototypes and they all have various degrees of 'kinda' working.  
Most important is getting some information from various stakeholders about the design, look & feel as well as usability and all that.  
After that feedback I can start putting the time in them to actually make them real.

Currently this is the first working prototype of fetching real data and using it to make visualisations:

- [ttltojson](https://danielvandevelde.github.io/meesterproef-1920/demos/ttltojson.html) - Totally works! Sort of dynamic(ly), I do need more than 3 datasets to really test everything.
