## Debriefing

### Case

From the different cases I could chose from I went with the 'Strvct' case as presented by Wallscope.
Wallscope is a company that focusses on developing technologies associated with big data and is located in Edinbrough, Scotland.
One of their technologies that they are working on right now is called Strvct. Strvct is a tool that helps their clients capture their knowledge in a _Structured Vocabulary_ (a tree of terms).  
The clients will be able to create/read/update and delete their own structured vocabularies which Wallscope can use to help their clients further.

### Assignment

I will create a website that will function as a front-end to Strvct.
This website will visualise the clients structured vocabulary in a way that will be easy to navigate.  
The user will also have the option to create and edit this vocabulary.

## Planning

- Week 1: First meeting, debriefing, research
- Week 2: First tests, iterations, code- / designreview
- Week 3 & 4: More testing/iterations as well as more reviews
- Week 5: Test final prototype & presentation

## Deliverables

- Design rationale (debriefing, assignment, code-explanation, substantiation)
- Product biography (iterations, method, procces, planning, sketches, tests)
- Reflection
- Working prototype for a target audience, available on multiple devices with real data and a good UX. (a.k.a. a happy client)

# First meeting

From the first meeting I have learned quite a lot about Wallscope and this assignment.  
We are mostly talking to Johnny who describes this project as his baby.
Antero will also be there to keep an eye on us and to see if we're moving in the right directions.
Ian will play the role of big grumpy boss (his words).

Clients will have an unique (to them) dataset and Wallscope needs to manipulate that dataset for their tools.
Stvct will be the tool that will let clients manipulate this data themselves so it's ready for the other tools Wallscope uses so it's easier for Wallscope to help their clients.  
This manipulated dataset will be a structured vocabulary and be built by Strvct.

The front-end of the tool might also want to introduce the concept of linked data and structured vocabularies to users so it's easier for them to understand.

Wallscope has already tried visualising data by using sunbursts and circle packing but that's not the prettiest and the most useful, especially with big datasets.

They have vocabularies, datasets and an API for me to test with.
I don't have to understand how _linked data_ / _knowledge graphs_ but it's a big part of what they do, so I probably should.

They use Taiga(?) for projectplanning.

#### Is there anything that is protected?

Maybe, he's gonna check.

#### Who is our user?

Someone who knows something, but doesnt get the technology.
Exposing their knowledge so 'we' can use it.
People create diagrams, word documents & files.

Mostly tree diagrams, fruit - vegetables, banana apple etc. as example.

We meet every moday, 3pm GMT+1
We keep in touch via Slack.

## Questions

- Everything in English?
- Deliverables as Word documents or a wiki?
