Hi there.

You can find my [wiki here](https://github.com/DanielvandeVelde/meesterproef-1920/wiki) which holds my ddebriefing, research,  product biography and all the other good stuff.  

The actual (finished) project that we're working on as a group can be found here:    
[Strvct Github repo](https://github.com/aaraar/strvct)    
Which has its own [wiki with even more information](https://github.com/aaraar/strvct/wiki)
